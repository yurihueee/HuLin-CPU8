# ECE251_FinalProject 
by Yuri Hu and Faith Lin
An 8-bit CPU was designed and implemented using Verilog 

## Instruction Set Architecture 
We designed an ISA that utilizes 16-bit instructions consisting of 3 different formats **Register (R-type)**, **Immediate (I-type)** and **Jump (J-type)**. In order for the machine to efficiently identify the type of instruction, all R-type have an opcode starting with 1 while J-type has an all zero opcode, everything else is classified as I-type.
